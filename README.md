# Data-Visualization

The following project is mainly for testing data visualization methods; specifically, we look and compare line plots, box plots, bar plots and stacked bar plots.  
	The first question we attempt to answer is how different are the ratings given by Metacritic, Rotten Tomato, and IMDB?

A quick glance shows Rotten Tomato has higher scores, while IMDB seems to have pretty consistent scores through out. For a bitter picture we plot a box plot of the same data.

This confirms our previous observation; we see Metacritic has the most variability, while RT has the highest average and IMDB being the lowest average and lowest variability.
Next we look at something more practical, movie revenue. We create a bar graph and find the following:

The graph above gives a general picture, and we notice most Pixar movies generate more revenue overseas. To get an even better view we stack the graphs on top of each other to get:

From the above analysis we see box plots provides us with a better picture when comparing multiple items with differing distributions, while a stacked bar plot gives us a better image of ratio between two probabilities.
